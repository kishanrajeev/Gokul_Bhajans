..................... Meaning ..........................
O Krishna! You are the beholder of Gokul that is
surrounded by forests. In Vrindavan, You were
holding Giri Govardhan. With Your unmatched beauty
You steal every one's heart.

You are dressed and thus ready to dance all the time.
You performs wonderful leelas with your dear devotees.
As a beautiful boy of youth, You are wandering all
the groves of Vrindavan forests.

You are beautifully carrying Your wonderful flute.
Your beauty is captivating all the cupids. You are
the one who stole the garments of gopis. O Govinda
Your leelas are understandable only to Your dears.

You are wearing a yellow silk dhoti. You are the one
who is the root and cause of Prema Bhakti of Your
dear devotees. O Krishna! O Govinda! You always roam 
the banks of Yamuna river.
