Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant! 

When Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda came 
dancing through Nadia, They gave these teachings: 
Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!
 
You are caught up in a whirlpool of senseless 
action and are sinking lower and lower. 
Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!
 
If you just understand that the spirit soul is the 
eternal servant of Krsna, you will never have any 
more sorrows. 

Chant Hare Krsna and your eyes will fill with 
tears and your body will feel transcendental 
shivering. Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!
 
Simply chant "Radha-Krsna" and join with us. 
Those are the only alms we beg. 

Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant! 
"All dangers will be gone when that Name is chanted",
says Bhaktivinoda Thakura. Chant, chant 
"Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!
