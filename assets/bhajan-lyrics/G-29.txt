Once upon a time, there was a great king
Then upon a time, on the death bed to die
Scared of facing the death, scared of dying alone
Asked his four queens, who could die with him        ... (Once)

First queen told the king, she couldn't go with the king
Because she had to stay, here with so many things
Second queen told the king, she couldn't die with the king
Hiding she had to marry, another after the king

Third queen told the king, that she had many friends
But she promised for sure, come for his last rites
Fourth queen told the king, who was neglected ill
Surely die with the king, see him tortured in hell     ... (once)

Who is the first queen, she is the body we care
Who is the second queen, the wealth that we dare
Body can never come, with us when we die
Wealth will change hands, as soon as we say bye

Who is the third queen, relations and the friends
Who will come with flowers, leave after funeral rites
Fourth queen is ignored, parama atma of soul
Coming as blind judge, ready to punish in hell      ... (Once)

Only the nishta in heart, for our guru deva
Make him come and take, all the lucky jivas
All the sastras say, guru has more mercy 
Than even the Lord, that may sound crazy.

O my guru deva, O my guru deva
I am at your door, begging for your grace
I have no strength, without your will
Just a dust of your feet, make me sing and dance
 
Hare krsna hare krsna
Krsna krsna hare hare
Hare rama hare rama
Rama rama hare hare
