Once upon a time, there was a parrot in cage
Then upon a time, a wise man came and bought
Taking it to his home, giving it all his time
Making the cage the best, so good and shine!

For the parrot's fair, cleaned the cage with care
For the parrot's galor, painted the cage with color
For the parrot's beauty, covered the cage with gold
Sprayed with costly scents, wiped with silken cloth....(Once)
 
Days and days went by, gone now even a week
While the cage looked great, the parrot became weak
Aho, aho ho! Two weeks now gone!
Sad and sad and sad, the parrot died and gone! .... (Once)
 
Neighbors ran and came, when he cried and cried
Shocked to see the parrot, died with no no food
Asked the wise man, ever he fed the parrot
Wise man then cried, 'I didn't feed the parrot'  .... (Once)

Like that parrot in cage, we the soul live 
Like that foolish man, body is what we care
Wearing gold jewels, wearing colored dresses
We care only the body, forgetting our soul       .... (Once)

Soul wants the food, that is the love of God
Without that very love, it can't live at all
Only goal in life, is to make our soul
Connected to that Lord, happy ever that's all  .... (Once)

Hear the story of Lord, making the soul happy
Sing the name of the Lord, making the soul in bliss
Chant the names of the Lord, making it bath in love
That the love in bliss, is the food to soul

Hare krsna hare krsna
Krsna krsna hare hare
Hare rama hare rama
Rama rama hare hare
