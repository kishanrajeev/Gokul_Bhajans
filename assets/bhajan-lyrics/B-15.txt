Shri Radhe Rani, de daro na baansuri meri 
Yaa bansi mein. pran basat hai
So bansi bhayi chori
Radhi Rani, So bansi bhayi chori     ... (Shri)

Kahese gaaon Radhe, kahese bajaoon
Kahese laaon, gaiya gheri         
Radhe Rani, kahese laaon, gaiya gheri... (Shri)

Yaa bansi mein. pran basat hai 
So bansi bhayi chori
Radhi Rani, So bansi bhayi chori     ... (Shri)

Mukh se gaaon kanha haath se bajao 
Lakuti se laaon gaiya gheri
Kanha more lakuti se laaon gaiya gheri...(Shri)

Haath dharat hoon tere paiya padat hoon 
Taras khao Rani meri
Radhe Rani Taras khao Rani meri      ... (Shri)

Meera ke prabhu giridhar naagara
Bansi lekar  chodi
Kanha more bansi lekar  chodi        ... (Shri)

Radha Rani, give me my flute!
My life resides in this flute
That flute got lost!

How do I sing and play?
How do I get my cows home?

My life resides in this flute?
That flute got lost!

Sing with your mouth and play with your hands
Get your cows home with a stick!

I am holding your hands, falling on your feet
Have pity on me!

Meera's lord Giridhar naga
You finally took the flute!
