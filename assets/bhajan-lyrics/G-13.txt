Radha Krishna Radha Krishna 
Krishna Krishna Radha 
Radha Krishna Radha Krishna 
Radha Radha Krishna (2)   ... (Radha)
 
Krishna is a cowherd boy
Radha Rani a queen
Krishna is very naughty but
Radha Rani is Sweet (2)   ... (Radha)

Krishna takes the cows to herd with
All his gopa friends 
Krishna Radha and the gopies 
All do the rasa dance (2) ... (Radha)

Gopis make the butter and
Krishna eats them all
Krishna gives to gopas and
Gopis catch them all (2)  ... (Radha)

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna 
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama 
Rama Rama Hare Hare
