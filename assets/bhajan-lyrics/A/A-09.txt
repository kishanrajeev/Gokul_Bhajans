gaurā pahu nā bhajiyā mainu
prema-ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu

adhane yatana kari dhana teyāginu
āpana karama-doṣe āpani ḍubinu

sat-sańga chāḍi' kainu asate vilāsa
te-kāraṇe lāgilo ye karma-bandha-phāńsa

viṣaya-viṣama-viṣa satata khāinu
gaura-kīrtana-rase magana nā hainu

keno vā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha pāiyā
narottam dās keno nā gelo mariyā

TRANSLATION

1) I did not worship Lord Gauranga Prabhu and thus I became full of suffering.  I refused to accept the treasure of pure love of Krsna, and thus I became lost.

2) I reject the treasure of love of Krsna and deliberately struggled to become poor.  I dived into a host of sinful deeds.

3) I rejected the association of the saintly devotees, and instead tried to enjoy among the impious non-devotees.  In this way I became caught in the noose of karma.

4) I continually drank the virulent poison of sense-gratification.  I refused to swim in the nectar of Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement.

5) Why do I stay alive?  What happiness do I have?  Why did Narottama dasa not die long ago?
