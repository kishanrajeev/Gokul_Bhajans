Ohe! vaishnava thākura, doyāra sāgara,
E dāse korunā kori
Diyā pada-chāyā, śodho he āmāya,
Tomāra carana dhori
 
Chaya bega domi', chaya dosha śodhi',
Chaya guna deho' dāse
Chaya sat-sańga, deho' he āmāre,
Bosechi sańgera āśe
 
Ekākī āmāra, nāhi pāya bala,
Hari-nāma-sańkīrtane
Tumi krpā kori', śraddhā-bindu diyā,
Deho' krsna-nāma-dhane
 
Krsna se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dīte pāro,
Tomāra śakati āche
Aami to' kāńgāla, 'krsna' 'krsna' boli',
Dhāi tava pāche pāche

------------------- Meaning --------------
1) O venerable Vaisnava, devotee of Krsna! 
   O ocean of mercy, be merciful unto your 
   servant. Give me the shade of your lotus 
   feet and purify me. I hold on to your 
   lotus feet.
 
2) Teach me to control my six passions; 
   rectify my six faults, bestow upon me the 
   six qualities, and offer unto me the six 
   kinds of holy association.*
 
3) I do not find the strength to carry on 
   alone the sankirtana of the holy name of Hari. 
   Please bless me by giving me just one drop 
   of faith with which to obtain the great 
   treasure of the holy name of Krsna.
 
4) Krsna is yours. You have the power to give 
   Him to me. I am simply your servant 
   running behind you shouting, "Krsna! Krsna!"
