-------- meaning ------------

1) O mind! How can you forget? Seeing you, the servants of Yamaraj clap their hands and laugh.

2) Day and night, you go on talking nonsense, but you can’t utter the holy names of Sri Hari. Obtaining this rare human form of life, for what happiness are you losing this greatest opportunity?

3) You consider your wealth and relatives as your own. But who will go with you? Being proud of your bodily strength, you didn’t care for anything and now you are stuck under the grip of the lord of death.

4) Even after seeing and hearing you couldn’t understand. You thought that which is empty is the essence. You broke your own head, now tell -- whose fault is that?

5) You do not know whether your body will fall now or later. You will remember all your so-called happiness once you are tied with the leather noose around your neck.

6) Chant the names of Hari, Hari constantly! Then only can you escape the punishment of Yamaraj. Premananda says, if you do not serve Hari, then may your face be turned black in shame!
