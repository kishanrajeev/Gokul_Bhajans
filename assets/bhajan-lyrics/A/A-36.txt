(1)
jaya jaya śrī guru, prema kalapa taru
adbhuta yāko prakāśa
 
(2)
hiyā ageyāna, timira vara jñāna
sucandra kiraṇe koru nāśa
 
(3)
iha locana ānanda dhāma
ayācita eheno patita heri yo pahuń
yāci deyalo harināma
 
(4)
duragati agati, asata mati yo jana,
nāhi sukṛti lava leśa
 
(5)
śrī vṛndāvana, yugala bhajana dhana,
mohe korolo upadeśa
 
(6)
niramala gaura, prema rasa siñcane,
pūralo saba mana āśa
 
(7)
so caraṇāmbuje, rati nāhi hoyalo
royata vaiṣṇava dāsa
