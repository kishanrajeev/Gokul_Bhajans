TRANSLATION

1) I offer prayers to the lotus feet of Visvambhara, who cuts away the defective consciousness of those who are influenced by Kali-yuga.

2) With the fragrance of His supremely sweet philosophy, name, qualities, etc., Mahaprabhu attracts His honeybee-like followers. By His causeless mercy, He removes the anguish of separation of His dear associates (like Advaita Acarya).

3) For a long time the hearts of the jivas in this world have been afflicted with ignorance due to maya, which He instantly destroys with His brilliant effulgence.

4) Radha-mohana, having become greatly attracted to Mahaprabhu whose unmatched splendor is always radiating out, is broadcasting His glories to all.
