TRANSLATION

1) Glory, glory to Lord Nityananda. He is Lord Balarama Himself. To deliver the fallen sinners He extends His two arms.

2) His half words spoken in a choked voice are the sweetest nectar. Whomever He sees He hugs in the ecstasy of spiritual love.

3) His eyes are always restless. They are like two black bees flying among golden lotus flowers.

4) Lord Nitai is the master of mercy. Seeing the people tormented by troubles, He strings for them a necklace of Lord Hari’s holy names. To person after person He gives that necklace.

5) The arrogant blasphemers and sinners He rips into shreds. To the poor fallen people He gives the gift of ecstatic spiritual love.

6) Calling out, “O! O Gauranga!”, He falls to the ground. His whole body is soaked with tears.

7) In his heart Vrndavana dasa thinks: Now Lord Nityananda is like a golden Mount Sumeru fallen to the ground.
