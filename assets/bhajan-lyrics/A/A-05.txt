gurudeva, kṛpā karke mujhko apanā lenā
maiń śaraṇa paḍā terī, caraṇoń meń jagaha denā

karuṇā-nidhi nāma terā, karuṇā barasao tum
soye huye bhagya ko, he nātha jagāo tum
merī nāva bhãvara dole, use pāra lagā denā

tum sukh ke sāgara ho, bhakti ke sahāre ho
mere man meń samāe ho, mujhe prāṇoń se pyāre ho
nita mālā japū terī, mere doṣa bhulā denā

maiń santoń kā sevaka hūń, guru caraṇoń kā dāsa hūń
nahīń nātha bhulānā mujhe, is jaga meń akelā hūń
tere dvār kā bhikhārī hūń, nahīń dil se bhulā denā

TRANSLATION

1) Gurudeva, bestow your mercy on me and accept me as your own. I have taken shelter of you. Please give me a place at your lotus feet.

2) Please shower your mercy on me because you are renowned as a storehouse of mercy. O my Lord, only then will my sleeping fortune wake up. My boat is caught in a whirlpool. Please take me across this turbulent ocean.

3) You are the ocean of happiness and shelter for bhakti. You are dearer to me than my life and are always on my mind. I chant your name every day. Please ignore my faults.

4) I am a servant of the Vaisnavas and of the lotus feet of my Guru. Please do not forget me because I am all alone, O Lord. I am a beggar at your door. Please do not ignore me at heart.
