(From Nawadwipa Dhama Mahatmya - Chapter 4: 1 to 10)

jaya jaya navadvipa-chandra sachi-suta
jaya jaya nityananda-raya avadhuta [1] 

jaya jaya navadvipa sarva-dhama-sara
yathaya ha-ila sri-chaitanya-avatara [2]  ... (Jaya)
....

navadvipe labhi taha eka-dine bhai [3]
 
sei navadvipa parikrama vivarana
sastra alochiya gai suna sadhu-jana [4]   ... (Jaya)

sastrera likhana ara vaisnava-vachana
prabhu-ajna ei tina mama prana-dhana [5]
 
e tine asraya kari’ kariba varnana

-------------- Meaning -----------
All glory to the son of Sachi, the moon of Nabadwip! All glory to the avadhut Nityananda Ray!

All glory to the best of all abodes, Nabadwip, where Sri Chaitanya appeared!

Brother, souls attain in Nabadwip in one day the result that others attain by residing in all the holy places.

O sadhus, listen as I discuss the scriptures and sing about circumambulating Nabadwip.

The writing of the scriptures, the words of the devotees, and the order of the Lord are my life and wealth.

Having taken shelter of them, I will describe the procedure for circumambulating Nadia. Everyone listen.

When Sri Jiva Goswami left home, he was eager at heart, calling out, “Nadia! Nadia!”

As he left Chandradwip and walked down the road, his eyes filled with tears.

Again and again, he called out, “O Gauranga! O Nityananda! O Life of the soul! When will You mercifully appear before me? 

O Nabadwip Dham, best of all abodes! When will I see you?”
