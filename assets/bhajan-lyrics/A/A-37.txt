TRANSLATION
1) O mind! Speak only about Gaura. Gaura’s name is the abode of nectar, and the worshipable bestower of unnatojjvala-prema.
 
2) In sleeping – Gaura, in dreaming – Gaura. Gaura is the star of my eyes. In life – Gaura, at the time of death – Gaura. Gaura’s name is the precious necklace I wear around my neck!
 
3) Keeping Gauranga inside my heart, I will sit alone and fix my mind on His enchanting moon-like form. I will gaze in His eyes and become absorbed in His beauty.
 
4) Without Gaura I cannot live. Gaura is my everything. I pray to give up my life taking the name of Gaura – I ask for nothing else.
 
5) Gaura’s movements, Gaura’s nature, Gaura’s smiling face, Gaura’s love, Gaura’s full form – all enter my heart.
 
6) Gaura is my dharma, Gaura is the object of my karma, Gaura is the essence of the Vedas. I surrender my life at Gaura’s lotus feet. It is Gaura who will take me across (the ocean of material existence).
 
7) Gaura is the essential sound vibration and wealth for that person in whose heart He manifests. Narahari dasa always prays to take shelter at the feet of such a person.
