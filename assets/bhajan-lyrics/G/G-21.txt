Happy new year, Happy new year

Drink and dance, drink and dance
Drink the wine and eat the meat 
Happy happy happy, happy new year!.

Devotees
Do you know death is coming surely here?
What did you do to save your self oh dear?
How many years you've seen oh dear
Not many more you understand very clear?     	

Lord Gaura came to teach the prayer
Don't waste time as death is near!
Did you chant during all these years?
Not many years come should be in tears!

Happy new year, Happy new year……

Devotees
Year comes year goes as you drink beer 
We are born we will die very damn sure! 
We should chant sure our daily prayer 
Will you get human birth again for sure?

New Year wishes are only for a year, 
There is no guarantee not for ever!
Chant Lord's name as a vow this year, 
You will be HAPPY and happy FOR-EVER!
