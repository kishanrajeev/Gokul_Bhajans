I am in a cool (fool’s) paradise
I am in a cool (fool’s) paradise
I am in a, I am in a…
I am in a cool (fool’s) paradise ….(I am)

I chat on my, many many phones
I surf-internet, so many times
I watch youtube, I watch my tube…
I watch many late cool movies!…(I am)

I have my facebook, upto the tip
I have whatsup way to my gossip
I chat I chat, gossiping all day…
I spent all time wonderful way!…(I am)

I eat dead and micro-waved food
I drink soda, for my tongue’s good
I eat and drink, I eat and drink…
Sitting on the couch all my day… (I am)

Watching sports and soap, is my life
Without it how I spend my very life?
No time no time, really no time
Even for my own home work too…(I am)

Just because masterji asked me to chant
I just touch on my tiny little beads
I wish I chant, I wish one day
Before the day that I will die…(I am)
