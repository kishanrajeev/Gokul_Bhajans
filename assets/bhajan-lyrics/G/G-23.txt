Once upon a time, there was a black crow
Then upon a time, saw a white swan
Flying every day, eating every way
Lived a happy life, until saw the swan!

Black crow went to swan, cried & told in brief
Best is swan in white, worst is crow in black
Wished it were white, happy it would be then
Wishing to be a swan, cried and cried in grief!

Aha but that swan, told it was too sad
Seeing a parakeet, lost its happy mood
Para keet it saw, had more colors  
Just its white color, was a big curse!

Then the crow and swan, met the parakeet
Told that they were sad, happy was the keet
Wished if they were, born with more colors
Life would have been, happy for ever!

But the para-keet, told it was too sad
Seeing a pea cock, made its mind go mad
He said that the peacock, was a happy galore
With its nice wings, dances in color(s)

Then the crow and swan, with the para-keet 
Went and met the peacock, deep in the forest
They said that the peacock, sure was the best 
Wishing that they too, were born like that

But the peacock told, it was too sad
Born with great beauty, was a big curse
Every moment then, living in fear
That it soon be caught, for its nice feather!

Looking at the crow, peacock told in tears
Born as black crow, was the best of all
Flying all the day, eating every way
With no no no fear, happy every day! .... (Once)
   
If one is content, with what he has got
Heâ€™s a happy man, in all the three worlds
Greed that makes the mind, mad and mad and bad
Drives the happiness, far and far away 
 
Thank the Lord for, what he has given
Sing the Lord for, mercy he showered
Chant his holy names, for his love for sure
Real happy life, surely ever there!
