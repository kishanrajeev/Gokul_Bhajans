Prelude:	
 [Yad gatvaa na nivartante
 Tad dhaama paramam mama..] (2) 

No one falls from Vaikuntha
No one falls from Goloka
Krishna taught us the Vedanta
Gita and Guru’s Siddhanta  	… (No one)

Blind men in this Kali Yuga
Lead with very wrong Vedanta 
Say no to their Siddhanta
Follow Sri Guru parampara	 … (No one)

Born from the belly of Maha Vishnu
Baddha Jivas come to Tatastha
We haven’t seen our Pita Krishna
As we looked at the Maha Maya 	… (No one)

Krishna sends from Goloka
His own dears to Brahmanda
They don’t fall from their Dhama
They come to take us to Goloka	… (No one)
