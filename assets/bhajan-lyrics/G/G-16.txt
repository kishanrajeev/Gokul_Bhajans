Jesus Christ was very beaten
For the gospel he was preaching
Haridas Thakur was all beaten
For the nama he was chanting       ... (Jesus)

Once Lord Siva was touring
Sat on His Nandi and going
Whatever He was then doing
All the people were blaming			... (Jesus)

People respect those are cheating
They do blame who is genuine
They don't have a pot for holding
God's mercy when it's pouring	    ... (Jesus)

Never give up your chanting
Never give up your serving
People may be all scolding
Never worry, you are golden!        ... (Jesus)

Hare Krsna Hare Krsna
Krsna Krsna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare					... (Jesus)
