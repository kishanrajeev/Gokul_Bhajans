I have a mall of all the gods
I have a home with so many gods
I have a mall, I have a mall
I have a mall with all the gods

If one god doesn't work for me
I do bring and add more god
I have crores of gods to choose from
And I have Lord Jesus too 

I have a god to remove my vigna
So I live like king jagana 
I have gods to change my karma
So I don't worry this janma

I have baba and mama gods 
Who eat meat so I am not odd
If gods eat meat and do drink wine
Why can't I kill for my tongue

Laxmi durga ganesh puja
Saraswati satya narayan puja
Reciting sahasra nama in bold
I ask wealth and health and gold

I must enjoy now not then
As much I can before I die
Hell and heaven are only in our mind
Foolish people don't know this!

Why should I worship Lord Krishna
Who does not give what 'I' want
Why should I go to his bhakta
Who wastes time by chant and chant!
