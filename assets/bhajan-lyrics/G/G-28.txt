Once upon a time, there was an orphan dog
Then upon a time, a man took her to home
Feeding bathing and patting, giving all the care
The man loved his dog, that was cute and fair!

Days and weeks and months, years now have gone
Then the cute dog, became old and sick
Costing too much then, to keep her still alive
Master thought and thought, what could be done!

One day the master took, old dog in his car
Covering her eyes, drove it too way far
Reaching a dead beach, letting her to run
Before the dog saw, master left and ran!

When the covering fell, dog then there found 
That her master was, no where to find
Hoping to go to home, waving her little tail
Waited for her master, sitting there ever!

Without food and sleep, tears filling in eyes
Ran to each who came, waving her little tail
Seeing all the ones, none was her master
Hoping still one day, he would surely come

Days and months gone, even a year went
Master never came, but she had the hope
Aho sick and old, one day fell and died
A sweeper took her body, threw it in the trash!

Like that poor dog, we are in this life
Real master is, sitting in our heart
Calling us everyday, weeping with real love
Waiting for us to take, to His sweet home!

Hare krsna hare krsna
Krsna krsna hare hare
Hare rama hare rama
Rama rama hare hare
