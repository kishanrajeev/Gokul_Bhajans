Once upon a time, I was a happy soul
Then upon a time, looked at maya whole
Wanted to enjoy her wild, became-her very child
Came to this world, came to this world!

I was eating meat, arguing it was neat
I was drinking wine, saying it was fine
Going to party and club, Gossiping all the while 
Thinking it was cool, thinking it was cool

Blinded by my greed, blinded by my brain
I was gambling cold, making so much gold
Saints when came and told, never to eat that stool
I told them in bold, no you are fool
 
Eat and sleep and mate, offend that I hate
Cat and dog and hog, all they do the same
Serving to my sense, serving to my mind
Wasted all my life, wasted all my life

Why I looked at her, I am sick at here
How I go back home, and be happy there
Saints told me once, the way to home
Is to cry for Him and, He will take us home!
