You became a chariot driver, for a war of a dear
You washed the feet of guests, I don't want to hear

You washed and massaged sri,Sudama's feet greater  ...(Why)

You begged and danced for the, will of gopis treat
You wore the holy dust of, vraja gopis' feet  
You cried when mother Yasoda, bound you on a stone
You carried the sandal of, Nanda baba's own      ... (Why)

You are controlled by the will of,  your own very dear
You hide your own glories , no one can be near 
Why do you do that, why do you do that,

O my sweet Lord!                                 ... (Why)
