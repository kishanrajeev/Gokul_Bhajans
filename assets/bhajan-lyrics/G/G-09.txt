G-08. Never To Vaikuntha
(Based on: Going Beyond Vaikuntha &
 Brhad Bhagavatamrta by Sanatan Goswami)

No to Vaikuntha
Never to Vaikuntha
Only Goloka - Krishna
Only to Goloka!             … (No)

In Vaikuntha,
I can’t play with You
I can’t laugh with You
I can’t eat with You!       … (No)

In Vaikuntha
I can’t dance with You
I can’t joke with You
I can’t run with You!       … (No)

In Goloka,
I can play with You
I can laugh with You
I can eat with You!         … (No)

In Goloka
I can dance with You
I can joke with You
I can run with You!         … (No)

--- Ending ---
No to Vaikuntha, Never to Vaikuntha!
Only Goloka, Only to Goloka!
