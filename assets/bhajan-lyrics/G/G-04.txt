I am a little Gokul Kid
I am a little flower to my Krishna
I worship my Gurudeva         (2)
Who can take me to Goloka     ... (I am)

I do chant my Krishna Nama
I do offer sweet rice Bhoga
I do sing nice bhajana Geeta  (2)
I do take maha maha Prasada    ...(I am)

I don't care for Jnana Karma
I don't want Paramatma Bhrahman
I don't want any Ashta Siddhi (2)
I don't want any Bhukti Mukti ... (I am)

Krishna is my Mata Pita
Krishna is my Prana Natha
I love Krishna I love Krishna (2)
I give my very life to Krishna ... (I am)

Hare Krsna Hare Krsna 
Krsna Krsna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama 
Rama Rama Hare Hare

--- Ending ---
I am a little Gokul Kid
I am a little flower to my Krishna
