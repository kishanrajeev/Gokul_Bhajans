Bhakta bhakta bhakta
I am a vishnu bhukta
In my company Kubera
I gave him a share-ah!

When I go for darshan
I don't stand and no no pain
I know ministers all ruling
No queue, no sweat no waiting!

You know we should take shelter
I made him my 'tax' shelter
You see as his color is black
So to dump my cash in black!

I shave worthless white hair
Ask wealth and health as fare
I am His bhakta get richer
This great trick is no brainer!

I do believe in Vishnu purana
Why should I go to Lord Krishna
As he Vishnu's black hair
Avatar makes just street beggar!
