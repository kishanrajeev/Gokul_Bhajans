Entire goloka vrindavan in the spiritual sky is happily dancing!
Enchanting divine songs are sung and echoed everywhere!

The leelas of govinda bala (krishna) are ever enchanting and supremely blissful.

By hearing the sweet sound of the flute of govinda bala (krishna),
the rain clouds are gently showering nectar.

On the bank of the Yamuna, seeing all these wonders,
the peacocks opened their beautiful wings and dancing.

Entire goloka vrindavan is flooded with divine bliss and happiness.

Nanda gopla (krishna) is seen beautifully standing 
with most beautiful face and smiling with His nectarean lips. 

Seeing the enchanting beauty of madhu-sudana, 
all the gopis completely lose their mind and intelligence.

Entire goloka vrindavan is flooded with divine bliss and happiness.
