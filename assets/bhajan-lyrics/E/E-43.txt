1. I have been born and dead so many times, and went through 
   one prayalaya after another.
   But I have not seen You in any of my unlimited births.
   So what is the use of all my lives?

2. Oh Krishna, You appeared in Gokul and performed wonderful
   leelas. All the gopis poured their love for You and danced 
   with You! You are the lord of all the worlds. However you 
   chose only to herd your dear cows and calves.
   
3. Oh the most beautiful Lord, O Govinda, by appearing as the
   son of Nanda Maharaja You made entire Gokul and all worlds
   so enchanting!
