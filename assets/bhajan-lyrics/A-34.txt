TRANSLATION
1) Who will go? Who will go, brothers? Who will cross over this ocean of material suffering? This Kali-yuga in which Sri Caitanya-avatara has appeared is blessed. [Caitanya-avatara does not come in every Kali-yuga.]
 
2) At the bathing place of my Gauranga, a free ferry-boat is waiting. There is no restriction – everyone is coming, including the lame, blind and distressed. All are climbing aboard to cross over.
 
3) Harinama is the boat, Sri Guru is the helmsman and the sankirtana party moving with up-raised arms are the oars!
 
4) All souls can cross over with the favorable winds of prema. Only Locana dasa is so unfortunate that, due to his own fault, he has been left behind.
