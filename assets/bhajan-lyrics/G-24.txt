Once upon a time, there was a yogi saint
Then upon a time, sat under a tree
Doing great tapas, in his yogic river
Tamed his body mind, got siddhic power!

Once he was in trance, a crow was on that tree
In its native way, it sang with sweet voice
When it sang in tune, ka ka ka ka kee
Made the saint to wake, broke his trance in piece! 

The yogi got anger, yelled at poor crow
Don't you know me? I am a yogi saint
As you broke my trance, I will curse you now 
Yogi stared at crow, the crow burned to ash!  ... (Once)

After he was angry, then he became hungry
Took his begging bowl, went to a village far
Standing front of a home, yelling for some food
Thinking in his heart, mighty power he got!

Saw a woman in home, deep in her prayers
Singing Lord's names, she was in tears
Seeing no no food, coming in the near
Yogi yelled at loud, stared at her in anger!  ... (Once)

Woman came to sense, told the angry saint 
I am not that crow, that you burnt to ash
Only when I am done, after serving my Lord
I can come to you, you should so wait

When the yogi heard, what the woman told
Wondered how this poor, woman knew that crow
Being in shame of his, lowly little power
Ran away from there, never to see him ever!  ... (Once)

Yogis jnanis sidhis, are not Krishna's dear
Because what they want, is name and power
They may have name, they may have power
Those are like poison, to the love of Lord!

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama 
Rama Rama Hare Hare!
