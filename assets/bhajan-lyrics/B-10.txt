...............Meaning..................

1) I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha, who 
gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja and whose nails are 
like chisels on the stone like chest of the demon 
Hiranyakasipu.
 
2) Lord Nrsimha is here and also there. Wherever 
I go Lord Nrsimha is there. He is in the heart 
and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nrsimha, 
the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.
 
3) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, 
who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion. 
All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush 
a wasp between one's fingernails, so in the same 
way the body of the wasp like demon Hiranyakasipu 
has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed 
nails on Your beautiful lotus hands.
