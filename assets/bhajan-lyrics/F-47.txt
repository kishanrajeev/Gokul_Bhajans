-----------------
In the the Gokul Bhavan temple of Ilobhu city, located in the Osun state in Nigeria,
with the mercy of Gurudeva, Sri Radha Madana Mohan has come to reside with Lord Gauranga.

In this Kali yuga, Lord Gauranga appeared as the most beautiful son of Saci Devi to give the glory of Nama Sankirtan.
In the mood of Smt Radha Rani and color of molten gold, mercifully gave the overflowing well of prema.

Sri Radha Madan Mohan who lifted giri govardhan is from Goloka Vrindavan always attracted by gopis and seen with gopas.
He is full of beauty and bliss and always likes to taste prema rasa.
