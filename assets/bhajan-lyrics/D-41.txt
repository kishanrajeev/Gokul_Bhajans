Radhe Kishori Dayā Karo
(Radhe lāduli Krpā karo)
Dayā Karo Rādhe Dayā Karo		.. 	(Radhe)

Ham te deenan koyi jag mein
Bān dayā ki tanak dharo    	    .. 	(Radhe)

Sadā dhari deenanupe shyamā
Yeh vishwās jo man hi kharo  	.. 	(Radhe)

Vishama vishay vishu jwāl māl mein
Vividu tāpp tāpanu ju jaro   	.. 	(Radhe)

Kaba hu barusāogi karunā 
Yehi baroso man hi dharo    	.. 	(Radhe)

Kaba hu toh dā rogi charanan
Mamase ichā yehi-i dharo		..	(Radhe)

Kaba hu toh vicharogi mo man
Madhu barusā jhar jharani jharo	.. 	(Radhe)

Dās tumāro ās aur ki
Haro vimukh gatti ko jhagado 	..	(Radhe)

Radhe Kishori Daya Karo (3) 		(Radhe)

O little girl Radhe, please have mercy on me
Please have mercy on me, O Radhe please have mercy on me

I am not anything in this world
Please have a glance of your mercy on me

I should always have my eyes on Shyama
I have this true belief in my mind

I am trapped in this poison, fire of material world
I am doing multiple austerities

When will you pour your compassion on me?
I have this faith filled in my mind

When will I be able to hold your feet?
I have this wish in my head

When will you come in my mind
And pour sweet nectar to mop the poison

I am your servant but have wishes for others
Please change this and stop conflicted 

O little girl Radhe, please have mercy on me
