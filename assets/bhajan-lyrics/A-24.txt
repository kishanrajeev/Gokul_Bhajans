yań kali rūpa śarīra na dharata
tań vraja-prema-mahānidhi kuṭharīka, kon kapāṭa ughāḍata

nīra-kṣīra-haḿsana, pāna-vidhāyana, kon pṛthak kari pāyata
ko saba tyaji, bhaji’ vṛndāvana, ko saba grantha viracita

jaba pitu vana-phula, phalata nānā-vidha, manorāji aravinda
so madhukara vinu, pāna kon jānata, vidyamāna kari bandha

ko jānata, mathurā vṛndāvana, ko jānata vraja-nīta
ko jānata, rādhā-mādhava-rati, ko jānata soi prīta

jākara caraṇe, prasāde sakala jana, gāi gāoyāi sukha pāota
caraṇa-kamale, śaraṇāgata mādho, tava mahimā ura lāgata

TRANSLATION

1) If Rupa Gosvami had not appeared in Kali-yuga, who would have opened the great store-house of vraja-prema and distributed its contents freely?
2) Just as a swan separates milk from water, who could have separated the rasas to taste them? Abandoning everything, he performed bhajana in Vrndavana and wrote his rasika literatures.
3) When the yellow forest flowers blossom and fruits ripen, he lived like a bee taking the nectar from lotuses – who could have understood the nectar he was collecting?
4) Who could have understood Krsna’s lilas in Mathura and Vrndavana? How could we have known the sweet vraja-lilas and the love between Radha-Madhava?
5) By the mercy of his lotus feet, all can sing about and attain such divine bliss. The surrendered Madhava dasa is always praying to embrace Rupa’s glories.
