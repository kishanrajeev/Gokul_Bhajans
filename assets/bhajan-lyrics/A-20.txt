dharare-śravaṇe nara, hari nāma sādare,

yadi kṛta pāpī ā-,dare kabhu mantraka 
      rāja śravaṇe kare pāna
śrī-krṣṇa caitanya, bale haya tachu dur-
      gama pāpa-tāpa saha trāṇa

      laha narahari nāma hārar
saṁsāre nāma la-i, sukṛti ha-iyā,
      tare-āpā mara durā cāra

ithe kṛta viṣaya, tṛṣṇa pahuṁ-nāma, 
     hārāyo dhāraṇe śrama tāra
ku-tṛṣṇa jagadā, nanda kṛta-kalmaṣa,
