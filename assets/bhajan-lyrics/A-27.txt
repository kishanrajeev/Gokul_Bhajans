ki rūpe pāibo sevā mui durācāra
śrī guru vaiṣṇave rati nā hoilo āmāra

aśeṣa māyāte mana magana hoilo
vaiṣṇavete leśa mātra rati nā janmilo

viṣaye bhuliyā andha hoinu divā-niśi
gale phāńsa dite phire māyā se piśācī

ihāre koriyā jaya chāḍāno nā yāya
sādhu kṛpā vinā āra nāhiko upāya

adoṣa-daraśi prabhu! patita uddhāra
ei bāra narottame koroho nistāra

TRANSLATION

How can an ill-behaved person like me attain devotional service? I have no loving attachment to Sri Guru and Vaisnavas. 

My mind is endlessly absorbed in maya, and I don't even have the slightest loving attachment to the Vaisnavas. 

I have been blinded due to being absorbed in sense gratification day and night and the witch named maya repeatedly hangs a noose around my neck. 

There is no way to defeat her or give her up unless I attain the mercy of the saints. O Vaisnava! O master! 

You do not look for faults, but you simply redeem the fallen! This time redeem this Narottama!"
