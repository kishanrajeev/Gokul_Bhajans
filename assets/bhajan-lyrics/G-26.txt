Once upon a time, there was a frog in the well
Then upon a time, a sparrow came to that well
Living at bottom of well, eating jumping sleeping
The frog lived along, believed the well was world  ... (Once)

When the sparrow told, that his well is not world
Frog then yelled at her, "No no you are a fool"
One day the angry bird, flew to bottom of well
Brought the frog out, letting to see the truth!

When the frog saw, what was standing so tall  
The bird then told the frog, that it was a hill
When the frog saw, what was shining so large
The bird then told the frog, that it was the sea   ... (Once)

When the frog saw, what were dancing in colors
The bird then told the frog, that they were the flowers
When the frog saw, what were tall and green
The bird then told the frog, that they were the trees

Bird then asked the frog, if he believed the bird 
The frog in shame told, he was the real fool
The bird then asked the frog, if to return to well
The frog then told the bird, no no I am not!       ... (Once)

Scriptures from the Lord, tell us all the truths
It is we the fool, don't believe them all
When a guru comes, shows the mighty worlds
Then we see the truth, clear and in color!

Hare krsna hare krsna
Krsna krsna hare hare
