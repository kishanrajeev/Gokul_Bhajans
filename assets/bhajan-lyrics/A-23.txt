je ānilo prema-dhana korunā pracur
heno prabhu kothā gelā ācārya thākur
 
kāhā mora swarūp rūpa kāhā sanātan
kāhā dāsa raghunātha patita-pāvan
 
kāhā mora bhatta-yuga kāhā kavirāj
eka-kāle kothā gelā gorā nata-rāj
 
pāsāne kutibo māthā anale paśibo
gaurāńga gunera nidhi kothā gele pābo
 
se-saba sańgīra sańge je koilo vilās
se-sańga nā pāiyā kānde narottama dās

.............  Meaning ........................

He, who brought the treasure of divine love and 
who was filled with compassion and mercy - 
where has such a personality as Advaita Acarya gone?
 
Where are my Svarupa Damodara and Rupa Gosvami? 
Where is Sanatana? Where is Raghunatha Dasa, 
the savior of the fallen?
 
Where are my Raghunatha Bhatta and Gopala Bhatta, 
and where is Krsnadasa Kaviraja? Where did Lord 
Gauranga, the great dancer, suddenly go?
 
I will smash my head against the rock and enter 
into the fire. Where will I find Lord Gauranga, 
the reservoir of all wonderful qualities?
 
Being unable to obtain the association of Lord 
Gauranga accompanied by all of these devotees 
in whose association He performed His pastimes, 
Narottama Dasa simply weeps.
