TRANSLATION

Refrain: Nitai is within and without. He is everywhere within this world. He is the lover and He is the sweetheart.

1) Everyone says it. Nitai is my regulative principles, my object of worship, and the light of my eyes. Nitai is in all ten directions. In fact, He fills all the three worlds.

2) Nitai as Ananga Manjari eternally serves sweet Srimati Radhika. He is non-different from Baladeva, whose beautiful face resembles millions of moons and is surrounded by sakhas and sakhis.

3) The sister of Radharani, Ananga Manjari, is very dear to Sri Syama, and she is the life and soul of all the sakhis. She decorates the arena of the temple named Mani Mandira.

4) Nitai sustains the yogapitha and becomes a throne for the Lord to rest on. Nitai is also the dress and ornaments.

5) He enjoys pastimes with the sakhis. What more can I say? Nitai is the eyes, mouth, and limbs of everyone. Nitai, Nitai, Nitai, Nitai, I see only Nitai dancing.

6) Raising my hands and chanting Nitai, I will go to Vraja. I, Vrindavana dasa, only request Nitai to kindly never leave me.
