[Ragam - Yaman kalyan - Talam -  adi]

Achyutam Keshavam Krishna Damodaram,
Rama narayanam Janakivallabham,
(praising the Lord Krishna, with different 
 names of Vishnu)

Kaun kehte hain Bhagvan aate nahi
Tum Meera ke jaise bulate nahi, ... Achyutam ...
(Who says God does not come? You don't 
 call Him with the devotion of Meera)

Kaun kehte hain Bhagvan khaate nahi,
Ber Shabri ke jaise khilate nahi, ... Achyutam ...
(Who says God does not eat? You don't 
 feed him like how Shabari fed him)

Kaun kehte hai Bhagvan Sote nahi,
Maa Yashoda ke jaise sulate nahin,
(Who says God does not sleep? You don't make 
 him sleep like how Mother Yashoda did)

Kaun kehte hai Bhagvan naachte nahi,
Gopiyan ki tarah tum nachaate nahin,
(Who says God does not dance? You don't make 
 him dance like how Gopis did)

Achyutam Keshavam Krishna Damodaram,
Rama narayanam Janakivallabham
Rama narayanam Janakivallabham
Rama narayanam Janakivallabham
