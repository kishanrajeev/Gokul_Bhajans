Yashomati maiya se bole Nandlala
Radha kyon gori
Yashomati maiya se bole Nandlala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
(krishna asks his mother yashoda, why radha is fair and I am dark?)

(1)Boli muskaati maiya lalan ko bataya
Boli muskaati maiya lalan ko bataya
Kaari andhiyari aadhi raat mein tu aaya
Ladla Kanhiya mera ho
Ladla Kanhiya mera kali kamli wala
Isiliye kala
(Mother said to him with a smile on her face that you came in a dark night. O my dear son you have a black kamli, thats why you are dark)
Yashomati maiya se bole Nandlala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
(krishna asks his mother yashoda, why radha is fair and I am dark?)

(2)Boli muskaati maiya sun mere pyare
Boli muskaati maiya sun mere pyare
Gori gori Radhika ke nain kajraare
Kaale nainon waali ne ho
Kaale nainon waali ne aisa jaadu dala
Isiliye kala
(Mother said to him with a smile on her face that radha is fair but her eyes are dark black and she has done some magic on you thats why you are dark)
Yashomati maiya se bole nandlala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
Radha kyon gori main kyon kala
(krishna asks his mother yashoda, why radha is fair and I am dark?)
