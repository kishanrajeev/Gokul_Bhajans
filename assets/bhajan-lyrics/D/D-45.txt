Ghanana ghana Ghana shyaam barsat
tulsi hasi Ghanshyaam bheejat
chalat atpat girat latpat
uthat chatpat mudat chhatpat
kari hatheli bund nirkhat
dekhi motin hasat parkhat
bund bikharat, mobhe surat
kabahu kheejat kabahun reejhat
tulsi hasi Ghana shyaam bheejat  ...Ghanan ghanan

Kaanha kilkat nanduri damkat
chhipat daamini palak jhapkat
chhan chhananananana meha barsat
jhan jhananananana nupur baajat
charan chumat megha harshat
chhui sakat nahi gagan tarsat
tulsi hasi Ghana shyaam bheejat ....Ghanan ghanan

Begi dhaavat chakita haari
bhuwana bhuwanaakara taari
naam le yashoda pukaari
kit gayo lalnaa bihaari
dikhi parat ho preet baandhi
kaanh bhijat dekhi reejhat
tulsi hasi Ghana shyaam bheejat ....Ghanan ghanan

Har haraaye der laagavat
god le achraa udaavat
shyaam machlat pun munaavat
bhichal jaa jal haath aavat
maathu ko rahi rahi chakaavat
bhui na dotat kachu na maanat
tulsi hasi Ghana shyaam bheejat ....Ghanan ghanan

In the month of Shravana (the rainy season), the clouds in 
the sky begin to make a thundering sound and extremely fine 
mist-like rain drizzles everywhere. The atmosphere is very 
beautiful and pleasant after the heat of the summer months, 
for at that time all the forests of Braj begin to bloom. 
Many types of flowers on both sides of the Yamuna, such as 
beli, chameli, jui, and madhavi begin to bloom. The 
bumblebees look here and there and chant, "Radhe Radhe" and 
the cuckoos also call out, “Radhe Radhe.” The peacocks and 
peahens all call out “Keka keka.” where is Krishna? At the 
time of Shravana, everything becomes green. The summer was 
dry, but now the rain has come and everything has come to 
life again.
