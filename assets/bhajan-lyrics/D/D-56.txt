Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Toso preet tod krishna kaun sang jodu
Toso preet tod krishna kaun sang jodu
(My beloved! Even if YOU break the relation between us, I will not. 
 Who else will I join my love to if I break it with you?
 (Meaning that Krishna is obviously most worth of receiving Mirabai's love. 
  Once broken with him, no one else is left)

Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
(My beloved! Even if YOU break the relation between us, I will not.)

Tum bhaye taruwar main bhai pankhiya
Tum bhaye sarowar main teri machiya
(If you are a grand tree, then I am a bird. 
 If you are a lake, I am a fish in it!)

Tum bhaye giriwar main bhai chhara
Tum bhaye chanda main bhai chakora
(If you are a hill, I am a stream. 
 If you are the moon, then I am the cakora bird.
[the cakora bird is known to stare at the full moon continuously]

Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
(My beloved! Even if you break the relation between us, I will not.)

Tum bhaye moti prabhu hum bhaye dhaga
Tum bhaye sona hum bhaye suhaga
Tum bhaye moti prabhu hum bhaye dhaga
Tum bhaye sona hum bhaye suhaga 
(If you are a bead, I am the thread and 
 If you are gold then I will be the auspicious one)

Meera kahe parbhu vraji ke wasi
Meera kahe parbhu vraji ke wasi
Tum mere thakur main teri dasi
(Mira says, my lord, who resides in vrajadhAma, 
 You are my lord and I am your servant!)

Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Toso preet tod karishna kon sang jodu
Toso preet tod karishna kon sang jodu
(My beloved! Even if YOU break the relation between us, I will not. 
 Who else will I join my love to if i break it with you?
 (Meaning that Krishna is obviously most worth of receiving Mirabai's love. 
  Once broken with him, no one else is left))

Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
Jo tum todo piya main nahi todu
(My beloved!even if you break the relation between us, I will not.)
