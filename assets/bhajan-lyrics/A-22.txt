Śrī kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu dayā kara more
Tomā’ vinā ke dayālu jagat-saṃsāre

Patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra
Mo sama patita prabhu nā pāibe āra

Hā hā prabhu nityānanda premānanda-sukhī
Kṛpāvalokana kara āmi baḍa duḥkhī

Dayā kara sītā-pati advaita gosāi
Tava  kṛpā-bale pāi caitanya-nitāi

Hā hā svarūpa, sanātana, rūpa, raghunātha
Bhaṭṭa-yuga , śrī jīva, hā prabhu lokanātha

Dayā kara śrī ācārya prabhu śrīnivāsa
Rāmacandra-saṅga mage narottama dāsa

...............  Meaning  ........................
My dear Lord Caitanya, please be merciful to me, 
because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship 
within these three worlds?
 
Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned, 
fallen souls, but I assure You that You will not find 
a greater fallen soul than me. Therefore, my claim 
is first.
 
My dear Lord Nityananda, You are always joyful in 
spiritual bliss. Since You always appear very happy, 
I have come to You because I am most unhappy. If You 
kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also 
become happy.
 
My dear Advaita Prabhu, husband of Sita, You are so 
kind. Please be merciful to me. If You are kind to me, 
naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityananda will also be 
kind to me.
 
Gaura’s love embodiment is shown by Gadadhara Pandita. 
Srinivasa Pandita and Haridasa Thakura are the ocean 
of mercy.
 
O Svarupa Damodara, personal secretary of Lord Caitanya, 
O six Gosvamis O Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami, 
Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, 
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami! 
O Lokanatha Gosvami, my beloved spiritual master! 
Narottama dasa also prays for your mercy.
 
O Srinivasa Acarya, successor to the six Gosvamis! 
Please be merciful to me. Narottama dasa always desires 
the company of Ramacandra Cakravarti.
