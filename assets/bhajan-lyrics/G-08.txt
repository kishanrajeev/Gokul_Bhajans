Maya Maya Maya
Catch me Maha Maya
Anyone calls for Krishna
Block and hold me Maya!   (Maya)

I say I have work, 
I say I am sick!
I say I have guest, 
Array I want rest!        (Maya)

I say I am driving,
I say I am shopping! 
I say body paining, 
Array it is raining!      (Maya)

O my Mother Maya
How I thank you Maya
So I gave my daughter
Your name Oâ€™ Maya!        (Maya)

O my Maha Maya
Radha Rani Chaya!
When you have me Maya
Why Krishna? Haya!        (Maya)
