Once upon a time, there was a man of wise
Then upon a time, dreamed a life that nice
Working all the day, harder every way
Saving all the wage, for that happy day!... (Once upon a time)
...........
Went to uncle john, in his rural ville
Asked to keep his wage, later get it all
Every week and then, saved his wage away
Thinking for the then, coming happy day!

Oh now he was old, felt that he would die 
Went to uncle john, asked his money that day
Oho oho there, something happened bad
Trusted friend john, ran away too sad!  ... (Once upon a time)

When the wise man knew, that his friend flew
Cried and cried and cried, didn't know what to do
All his years work, all his savings hard, 
Gone with no no trace, died of broken heart!

Like that foolish man, like an ass we work
Greedy all the way, make a massive wealth 
Yama when comes for sure, have to go in bare 
Leaving all we have, not a penny there!	... (Once upon a time)

Live a simple life, happy you will feel
Spend the day and night, chant and sing by soul
Real wealth is that, really really cool
All that comes with us, otherwise you are fool!

Only if we chant, every single day
Only if we sing, Lord in every way
When we leave this world, all these come sure
For that real life, happy happy ever!  	... (Once upon a time)
