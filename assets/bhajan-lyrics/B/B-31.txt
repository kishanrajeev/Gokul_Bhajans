mama mana mandire raha niśi-din
kṛṣṇa murāri śrī kṛṣṇa murāri

bhakti pritī mālā candan
tumi nio he nio citta-nandan

jīvana maraṇa tava pūja nivedan
sundara he mana-hāri

eso nanda-kumār nanda-kumār
habe prema-pradīpe āratī tomār

nayana jamunā jhare anibār
tomāra virahe giridhāri

bandana gane tava bajūk jīvana
kṛṣṇa murāri śrī kṛṣṇa murāri
