bandhu-sańge yadi tava rańga parihāsa, 
thāke abhilāṣa (thāke abhilāṣa)
tabe mora kathā rākha, jeyo nāko jeyo nāko,
mathurāya keśī-tīrtha-ghāṭera sakāśa

govinda vigraha dhari’, tathāya āchena hari,
nayane vańkima-dṛṣṭi, mukhe manda-hāsa
kivā tri-bhańgama ṭhāma, varṇa samujjvala śyāma,
nava-kiśalaya śobhā śrī ańge prakāśa

adhare vaḿśī-ṭī tā’ra, anarthera mūlādhāra,
śikhi-cūḍākeo bhāi koro nā viśvāsa
se mūrti nayane here, keha nāhi ghare phire,
saḿsārī gṛhīra je go hoya sarva-nāśa

(tāi mora mane baḍa trāsa)
ghaṭibe vipada bhārī, jeyo nāko he saḿsāri,
mathurāya keśī-tīrtha-ghāṭera sakāśa

TRANSLATION
1) If you want to enjoy laughing and joking with friends and family, if this is really your desire, then listen to me. Don’t go, don’t go to Mathura (Vrndavana) to Kesi-ghata.

2) There Sri Hari has taken the form of Govinda, who gives pleasure to all, whose crooked glance is quite captivating, whose mouth is gently smiling, who is standing in His tribanga pose, whose complexion is a very effulgent syama color, and whose limbs are attractive like tender new leaves.

3) The sound of His vamsi enthroned upon His lips is the root cause of madness. Brother, have no faith in that person who wears a crest of peacock feathers. If you see that form, you will not be able to return home again. Your family life will be destroyed. 

4) (This is my great fear!) There will be great danger if you go there. If you want to enjoy family life, don’t go to Mathura near Kesi-ghata.
