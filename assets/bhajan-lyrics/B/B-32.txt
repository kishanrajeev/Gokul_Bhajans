ehi murāre kuñjabihāri
ehi praṇata jana bandho
he mādhava madhu mathana vareṇya
keśava karuṇā sindho

ehi nibhṛta patha pāntha
tvāmiha yāche daraśana dānam
he madhusūdana śānta

nava nīraja dhara śyāmala sundara
candra kusuma ruciveśa
gopigaṇa hṛdayeśa
govardhana dhara vṛndāvana cara

rādhā rañjana kaḿsa niṣūdana
praṇa tistāvaka caraṇe
nikhila nirāśraya śaraṇe
ehi janārdana pitāmbara dhara
kuñje manthara pavane

(1) O Krishna, O Murari! The one who resides in the sacred grove (kunja)Please come to me. Devotees surrender unto you as a friend. Hey, charming Madhava, you stir up the minds of your devotees. O Kesava, you are the ocean of compassion.

(2) Your sound is heard in the enchanted groves.You attract the devotees like the bumble bees are attracted by fragrant flowers. O my dear! Please come to me and help me to cross the lonely path. Please give me your darsan. Hey Madhusudhana, please give me peace.

(3) Hey Krishna! You look like a fresh and beautiful blue lotus flower and appear like a flower in moonlight.  You are the one who rules the hearts of Gopis. You lifted the Giri Govardhana. You wander around in Vrindavan. 

(4) You are the delight for Radha Rani. You are the one who slayed Kamsa. Only your lotus feet make my life complete. You are the only shelter to all who are helpless. O Janardana, who is adorned with the yellow pitambara, you are the wind that churns the sacred grove.
