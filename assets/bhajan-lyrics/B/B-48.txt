TRANSLATION

1) For serving the lotus feet of the charming daughter of King Vrsabhanu, I will become a sheltered maidservant of Her maidservant. Indeed, I will live only for the happiness of Sri Radha, and I will always endeavor to increase Her joy.

2) I will understand within my heart that Krsna feels happiness only when Radha is happy. I will thus never, ever dare become desirous of abandoning Radhika's lotus feet to be with Krsna myself.

3) All my associate sakhis are my supreme well-wishers, my best friends, and they are the teachers of my lessons in conjugal love. Simply by following them, I will serve the lotus feet of Radha, which are just like desire-fulfilling trees.

4) I am forever partial and prone to favoring the party of Sri Radhika. I will never even look upon those persons who have abandoned Her entourage, whoever they may be and regardless of what they preach.
