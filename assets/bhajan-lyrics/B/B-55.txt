TRANSLATION

1) When will I be a young gopi-maidservant?  When will Sri Rupa-manjari directly order me?  When will that auspicious time be?

2) When will Sri Rupa-manjari repeatedly order me about, saying: "O maidservant, come here.  Quickly arrange for my fancy garments and ornaments."

3) By hearing these orders I will become delighted.  These orders will completely absorb the attention of my purified mind.

4) When, in Sri Rupa-manjari's service, will I fill a jeweled tray with various paraphernalia for worship?  When, engaged in her service, will I fill a golden goblet with aromatic water?

5) When will I be able to quickly approach the Divine Couple?  When will Narottama dasa attain this condition of life?
