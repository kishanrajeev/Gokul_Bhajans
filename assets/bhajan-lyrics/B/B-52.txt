....... Meaning .......

We offer our worship to the ancient and sacred texts. They contain the knowledge of religion, devotion, and science.

The great Puranas and the Bhagavatam are pure. Their essence has been distilled by the wise sage Shuka and is like the fruit of the Vedic literature. They are full of the nectar of supreme bliss. They describe the ocean of divine play and the enjoyment of divine love.

They destroy the three-fold miseries and remove all impurities. They remove the fear of birth, death, and the cycle of reincarnation. Those who serve them continuously experience all happiness. They are the great medicine for the heart, and they sing the glories of Lord Vishnu.

They destroy the delusion caused by worldly pleasures. They destroy impurities, attachment, and ignorance. They reveal the mysteries of the Bhagavatam's philosophy. They give knowledge of the supreme light and the ultimate reality.

They delight the minds of great sages. They are enjoyed by those who have a taste for the divine and describe the delightful pastimes of the Lord. They provide both material enjoyment and liberation, and also increase love for the Lord. They are dear to the wise and those who have renounced all material desires.
