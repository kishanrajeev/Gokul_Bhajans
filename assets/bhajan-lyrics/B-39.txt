rādhikā caraṇa reṇu, bhūṣaṇa koriyā tanu,
anāyāse pābe giridhārī
rādhikā caraṇāśraya, ye kore se mahāśaya, 
tāre mui yāi bolihārī 

2
jaya jaya rādhā nāma, vṛndāvana yāra dhāma, 
kṛṣṇa sukha vilāsera nidhi,
heno rādhā guṇa gāna, na śunilo mora kāna, 
vañchita korilo more vidhi

3
tāra bhakta saṅge sadā, rasa līlā prema kathā, 
ye kore se pāy ghanaśyāma
ihāte vimukha yei, tāra kabhu siddhi nāi, 
nāhi yeno śuni tāra nāma

4
kṛṣṇa nāma gāne bhāi, rādhikā caraṇa pāi, 
rādhā nāma gāne kṛṣṇa candra.
saṅkṣepe kohinu kothā, ghucāo monera byathā, 
duḥkhamaya anya kathā dhanda

 Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings:
 
(1)
“Anyone who decorates one’s body with Rādhikā’s foot dust easily gets Giridhārī. I praise any great soul who takes shelter of Rādhikā’s lotus feet!” 

(2)
“Glory, glory to the holy name of Rādhā, that resides in Vṛndāvana, and that is the jewel of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes! Fate has deprived me by not letting me hear the glorification of Rādhā!”

(3)
“Anyone who associates with Rādhā’s devotees and speaks about Her rasa, Her pastimes and Her love, will attain Ghanaśyāma (Kṛṣṇa), but anyone who is against this will never attain perfection. Let us not even hear these people’s names.”

(4)
“O brother! When you sing Kṛṣṇa’s name you will get Rādhikā’s lotus feet and when you sing Rādhā’s name you will get Kṛṣṇa-candra. I told you this shortly, so now extinguish the pain in your mind. All other topics are simply miserable!
