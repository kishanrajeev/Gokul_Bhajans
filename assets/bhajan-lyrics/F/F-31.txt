................Meaning...............
1. I want to be in a world where there is no money,
   and no materialistic people. There I can sing 
   the names and glories of Sri Radha Krishna to
   the full satisfaction of my tongues without stop.

2. I want to be in a world where there is no need
   to sleep and there no hunger. There I can always
   dance to the tune of Sri Krishna's sweet flute.
   
3. I want to be in a world where there is no dream,
   and no memory of anything (except Radha Krishna).
   There I can be part of their sweet pastimes, every
   morning, evening, night and all the time.
