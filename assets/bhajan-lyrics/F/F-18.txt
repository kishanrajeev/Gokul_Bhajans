..................... Meaning ..........................
[O Krishna! You dwell in the twelve forests of Goloka
Vrindavan.] You appeared in the forest where Gokul is.
You dwell in the hearts of Your dear gopis. You dwell 
with the residents of Gokul. You completely occupy in the
mind of Srimati Radhaka and of all the gopis!

You roam in Vrindavana and Bhandir vana forests. You roam
in the Bhadra vana and Bahul vana forests.

You roam in the Khadir vana and Kumuda vana forests. You
roam in the Kamya vana and Tala vana forests.

You roam in the Madhu vana and Loha vana forests. You roam
in the Maha vana and Bilva vana forests.
