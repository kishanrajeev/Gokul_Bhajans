------------------------------------------------------
In the Ter Kadamba forest of Vrindavan, Cuckoo birds 
are ecstatically calling, searching and waiting for their 
dear Lord Sri Krishna.

Parrots on trees are talking with chocked voices and
peacocks are dancing with their wide opened wings. 
All the trees with affection are showering with their 
flowers and waiting and searching for their Krishna.

Rain clouds are beginning to appear on the sky for 
giving shade and the gentle breeze is blowing to 
welcome their sweet Lord. All the insects and birds 
and everything is singing to glorify, and the deers
are also waiting for their dear Krishna who loves 
and embraces every one of them.

O sakhi, all my mind has become fully mad and 
throbbing to meet Him. Me and my mind are desperately 
looking for that beautiful son of Nanda Maharaja.
