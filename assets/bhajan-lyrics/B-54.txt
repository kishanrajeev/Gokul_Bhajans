TRANSLATION

1) I timidly follow behind Sri Rupa-manjari.  When will she say to me: "Fetch some water for the Divine Couple?

2) When will the Divine Couple, compassionately smiling, say: "Where has Rupa-manjari gotten this young maidservant?"

3) Hearing these words, Sri Rupa-manjari will say: "Manjunali gave this maidservant to me.”

4) At that time I will feel very humble at heart, and I will diligently engage in the service of the Divine Couple.

5) When will the Divine Couple directly speak in this way to Narottama dasa, engaging him in Their service?
