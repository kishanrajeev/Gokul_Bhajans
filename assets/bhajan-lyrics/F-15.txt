.................Meaning..........................
O Krishna! You wear the garland of forest flowers
from Vrindavan and You are the one who lifted Giri
Govardan. You roam on the banks of Yamuna and is
so beautiful and decorated attracting every one.

You are a beautiful son of gopa the Nanda Maharaja. 
When Lord Indra became egoistic, you the hero of 
all the heros killed his ego (also means that only
devotion to You can kill the dominance of sense)

You, who is the source and holder of everything 
cannot be known by studying Vedas. But you are so 
near and dear to your pure bhava bhaktas.

You also became Your own devotee (Lord Caitanya)
and as the ocean of mercy showered mercy on all.
You Yourself became the wonderful Govardhana and
for me You are the only shelter.
