O Yashoda! What kind of tapas have you done?
Krishna the para-brammam who is everywhere is calling you "Mother"

O Yashoda, you are feeding your milk and caring Him as your baby
Who has actually created all the 14 planetary systems!
O Yashoda! What kind of tapas have you done?

Sanaka and so many yogis were doing so much of tapas..
Whatever the great results they got is a dust compared to what you got!
O Yashoda! What kind of tapas have you done?

O Yashoda! Lord Brahma, Lord Indra are envious of your greatness!
You even tied Him, made Him to close His mouth and weep afraid of you! 
O Yashoda! What kind of tapas have you done?
