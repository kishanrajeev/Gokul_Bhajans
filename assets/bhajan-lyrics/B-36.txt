prabhu he! tuwā pade e minati mor
tuwā pada-pallava, tyajato maru-mana
viṣama viṣaye bhelo bhor	... (prabhu)

uthayite tākata, puna nāhi milo-i
anudhina korohun hutās
dīna jana nātha, tuhun kahāyasi
tumāri caraNa mama ās		... (prabhu)

aichana dīna jana, kohi nāhi milo-i
tuhun more koro parasād
tuwā jana sange, tuwā kathā range
chāDuhun sakala paramād		... (prabhu)

tuwā dhāma māhe, tuwā nāma gāoto
gowāyabun divā nisi ās
tuwā pada chayā, parama susītala
māge bhakativinoda dās		... (prabhu)
---------------------------

O Lord! I offer this humble prayer at Your feet. 
I gave up the shelter of Your feet, which are soft as newly-grown
leaves, and now my mind has become dried up like a desert, being 
scorched by the fire of absorption in horrible worldliness.

I find no strength to rise again, and thus I spend my days bitterly 
lamenting. O Lord who is called the master of the meek and humble! 
Your lotus feet are my only hope.

There has never been a soul as forlorn as me. Please be merciful
and award me the association of Your devotees, for by tasting the 
pleasure of hearing discussions of Your pastimes I shall give all evils.

One hope animates my soul: to spend day and night singing Your
holy name while living in Your divine abode. Your servant Bhaktivinoda 
begs a place in the supremely cooling shade of Your lotus feet.
